## BUGS

#0C0E15 is not a solarized color

Tree lines are black (dark & light)

Page outlines are black (dark & light)

subwindow bg is pitch black (dark & light)

Not sure if [GeneralColors] has too much overlapping colors

Slider disabled/inactive blends in too much with the background (still)

"fill/progress" disabled/inactive blends in too much with filled/active (dark & light)

Spins unpressed bgcolor -> border color
	pressed color magenta -> pressed color

## DONE

I think tri-state should be a color: yellow.

Selected object tickbox transparency -> 100%

Cannot see outline on pressed buttons
	(flat buttons not as bad)
	Gonna try RED.

Slider "pressed" -> Base01

window highlights -> colorful

slider -> multi-colored :)

Disabled progress bar is completely invisible 
	(active v. inactive)

Highlighted text -> 80%, used colors more than values

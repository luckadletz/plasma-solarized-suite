plasma-solarized-suite

Everything you should want to get your entire KDE plasma desktop experience solarized!
And some fonts, icons, cursors, and other things I think go well together.

When possible, I'll add the official repos as git submodules, so to get them, run:
git submodule update -i
In other cases, I've hard-forked and tried to preserve original author credit and licenses.

Gonna do dark first, but day/night cycling of light/dark would be rad.

## Icons: iconpack-obsidian
Gnome Icon Pack based upon Faenza

I believe the best fit is Amber-SemiLight or Teal-SemiLight, but they all look pretty good.

## Font: encode-sans & fira-code
Work sans is included as an alternative.
Fira-code supports ligatures, which may take some extra installation.

## Cursor: Posy-Black-Tiny Custom Solarized
Original from: https://git.auteiy.me/dmitry/cursorsPosy/-/archive/master/cursorsPosy-master.tar.gz?path=themes

TODO: All of it, maybe some redesign

From: https://github.com/zayronxio/Plasma-MojaveCT/
Light theme is included as an alternative.

TODO: Recolor ll of it.
